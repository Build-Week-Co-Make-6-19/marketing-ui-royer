<h1 on image>Ever get frustrated that a problem in your town or neighborhood goes ages without being resolved? 


<pothole image>
You might have road issues (potholes, dangerous areas), overgrown plants, or anything else that makes living where you live a little less pleasant. With Co-make you can make your voice heard on the issues you would like to see resolved in your community.
<steps vertor>
Three simple steps: 
1. Describe the problem. 
2. Other locals upvote the problem. 
3. Problems with the most upvote get prioritized by local government or HOAâ€™s to be resolved first. 


<community-reward image>
As well as seeing real change in your community, you get rewards for being a positive community member in the form of points, freebies, and local recognition.
